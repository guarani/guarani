# Hey — I'm Paul 👋

I’m an Australian iOS engineer with 10+ years of experience building features used by millions across the **Day One** and **WordPress iOS** apps.

## 💻 Open Source Contributions

At Automattic, I made sponsored open source contribitions to a number of popular repos: 

- [**WordPress iOS**](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-iOS/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aguarani+is%3Aclosed)
- [**Gutenberg Mobile**](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aguarani+is%3Aclosed)
- [**Gutenberg**](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aguarani+is%3Aclosed)

I became proficient at working asynchronously on teams spanning EU, US, and APAC timezones. I shipped UIKit and SwiftUI features, managed iOS fortnightly releases and contributed to the direction of the WordPress Mobile team (see my post, [Contribute to the Future of the WordPress App](https://make.wordpress.org/mobile/2023/04/11/contribute-to-the-future-of-the-wordpress-app/)).

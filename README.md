# Hey there — I'm Paul 👋

I'm an Australian iOS engineer with over a decade of experience building polished, high-scale apps across fintech, publishing, and wellness. I’ve led mobile teams, shipped App Store features used by millions, and contributed to open source projects like **WordPress iOS** and **Gutenberg Mobile**.
